# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Neural-Network
I built a neural network model to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the sklearn dataset. I then included data preprocessing, training with TensorFlow/Keras, evaluation, and a predictive system. It achieved 96.5% test accuracy with confidence based output.
